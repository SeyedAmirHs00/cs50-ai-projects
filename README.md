# CS50 AI

This repository contains my solutions to the projects from Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. Each project demonstrates different concepts and techniques in AI, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and more.

### List of Projects

1. **Project 0: Search**
    - Implement depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search algorithms to solve a maze.

2. **Project 1: Knowledge**
    - Build a knowledge-based system using propositional logic to solve puzzles.

3. **Project 2: Uncertainty**
    - Use probability and Bayesian networks to predict the likelihood of various outcomes.

4. **Project 3: Learning**
    - Implement machine learning algorithms to classify data and make predictions.

5. **Project 4: Neural Networks**
    - Build and train neural networks to recognize handwritten digits.

6. **Project 5: Traffic**
    - Use reinforcement learning to train an agent to manage traffic lights.

### How to Run

Each project directory contains a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the code and what dependencies are required.

### Acknowledgements
