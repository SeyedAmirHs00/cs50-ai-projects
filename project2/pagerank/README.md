# PageRank Project

## Overview

The PageRank project is part of the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
with Python course. In this project, you will implement the PageRank algorithm, 
which is used by search engines to rank web pages in their search results. 
The algorithm assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, 
such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set.
