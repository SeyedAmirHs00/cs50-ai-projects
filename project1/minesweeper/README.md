# MineSweeper

This is a completion of Minesweeper for the CS50 AI project.

## Overview

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them. This implementation is part of the CS50 AI course, demonstrating the use of artificial intelligence to solve the Minesweeper game.

## Features

- **AI Solver**: Uses logical inference to deduce the locations of mines.
- **User Interface**: Interactive command-line interface to play the game.
- **Customizable Board**: Allows setting different board sizes and mine counts.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the dimensions of the board and the number of mines.
3. Use the commands to reveal cells or mark them as mines.
4. The AI will assist in making logical moves to avoid mines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CS50 Library for Python
